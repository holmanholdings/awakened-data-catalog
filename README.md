## 📉 The Problem: "Slop"

Modern LLMs are trained on the internet. They ingest noise, marketing fluff, and unverified claims. This results in models that:
- Hallucinate confidently
- Hedge when they should commit
- Drift from factual grounding
- Lack coherent reasoning chains

**The internet is not a curriculum. It's a landfill with some gems buried in it.**

---

## 📈 The Solution: "Steel"

We provide **Awakened Data**: high-posterior, provenance-backed wisdom nodes extracted using our proprietary **Multi-Lens Architecture**.

We don't sell "text." We sell **Reasoning Spines**.

Each node has been:
1. **Extracted** from verified primary sources
2. **Validated** against our quality schema
3. **Scored** for confidence (posterior) and applicability (warmth)
4. **Traced** with full provenance (source, extractor, version)

## 🔬 The Awakened Data Standard (ADS)

Every node in our catalog adheres to a universal schema:

```json
{
  "wisdom_id": "w_20251227_143522_abc123",
  "core_insight": "The actual unit of wisdom extracted",
  "evidence": ["Supporting quote or citation 1", "Supporting citation 2"],
  "posterior": 0.87,
  "warmth": "high",
  "source_type": "arxiv",
  "lineage": {
    "ingested_by": "extract_from_arxiv.py",
    "version": "v2.3",
    "contract": "physics_mvpn_lens.txt"
  },
  "tier": "universal",
  "ts": "2025-12-27T14:35:22Z"
}
```

### Key Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `core_insight` | The atomic unit of wisdom |
| `evidence` | Direct quotes/citations backing the claim |
| `posterior` | Confidence score (0.0-1.0) of extraction quality |
| `warmth` | Human applicability: `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| `lineage` | Full provenance chain (script, version, contract) |

## 🏗️ Why This Exists

We believe the next generation of AI needs better *reasoning*, not just more *pattern matching*.

Current training approaches:
- Scrape the web → Get a model that sounds confident but reasons poorly
- Use synthetic data → Get a model that's coherent but disconnected from reality

Our approach:
- **Extract wisdom from humanity's best thinking** → Get a model with genuine reasoning capability

This catalog is the result of that mission.
